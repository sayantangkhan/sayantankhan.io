# sayantankhan.io
Source code for my personal website hosted at www.sayantankhan.io.

## Requirements

To build the website, a Python virtualenv with the packages from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) installed is required. To build the CV, `texlive-full` might be required, for the LuaLaTeX component.

Run `build_script.sh` to build the CVs, and the website.
