I was a graduate student in pure mathematics at the University of Michigan, advised by Alex Wright.
My thesis focused on hyperbolic geometry, Teichm√ºller dynamics, and Patterson-Sullivan theory.
I am currently learning how to use the [Lean theorem prover](https://lean-lang.org/), formalizing results about $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ in Lean, and documenting my learning [here](tag/lean.html).

Outside of math, I enjoy rock climbing and [cycling](pages/cycling.html), proselytizing [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and programming in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
