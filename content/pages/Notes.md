<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alexmw/Math797Notes.pdf">Hierarchically hyperbolic spaces and applications to Teichmüller theory (i.e. the Masur-Minsky machinery)</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('hhs'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="hhs" style='display:none;'>
<br> These are course notes for a course Alex Wright taught in Winter 2022 on hierarchically hyperbolic spaces. These notes were co-written with <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/phd-students/shabari.html">Chenakkod</a>, <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~havijw/index.html">Haviland</a>, <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/phd-students/ckausik.html">Kausik</a>, <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/phd-students/shchetka.html">Shchetka</a>, <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alexmw/">Wright</a>, and <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/phd-students/twyu.html">Yu</a>.

<a href="pdfs/notes/superrigidity_talk.pdf">A tour through the proof of Margulis Superrigidity</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('superrigidity'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="superrigidity" style='display:none;'>
<br> These are notes for the talk I gave on Margulis Superrigidity at the topology seminar at the
University of Michigan in Fall 2019. This is more or less based on the sketch of the proof in
Dave Witte Morris' <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0106063"><i>Introduction to Arithmetic Groups</i></a>.

<a href="pdfs/notes/N-T_classification.pdf">The Nielsen-Thurston classification of mapping class elements</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('nt_classification'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="nt_classification" style='display:none;'>
  <br> These notes contain somewhat detailed proof of the Nielsen-Thurston classification of the elements of the
  mapping class group. Most of the proof is from Bruno Martelli's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02592">
    <i> An Introduction to Geometric Topology</i>
  </a>, although I did need to fill in a few details on my own. However, these notes are still far from self-contained
  and should be treated more like a supplement to the section in Martelli's book.

<a href="pdfs/notes/howe_moore.pdf">Upgrading ergodicity to mixing</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('howe_moore'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="howe_moore" style='display:none;'>
  <br> These are notes I wrote for a talk in the student dynamics seminar at the University of
  Michigan on the proof and applications of the Howe-Moore theorem. In a nutshell, the Howe-Moore
  theorem says that if the action of a semisimple Lie group is ergodic, it is also mixing, which
  provides a quick and easy way to show some related actions are mixing, for instance, the geodesic
  flow on a finite volume hyperbolic surface.

<a href="pdfs/notes/geodesic_flow_symmetric_space.pdf">The geodesic flow on symmetric spaces</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('symmetric_space'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="symmetric_space" style='display:none;'>
  <br> These are notes I wrote for a talk in the student geometry seminar on the geodesic flow on
  symmetric spaces.  The main point of this talk was to illustrate the the geometry of symmetric
  spaces, and the geodesic flow in particular can be completely understood in terms of the linear
  algebra of the associated semisimple Lie groups. As an application, we used just linear algebra to prove
  that the geodesic flow on the any finite volume rank 1 locally symmetric space (of non-compact type) is
  ergodic.

<a href="pdfs/notes/entropy_notes.pdf">Notes on entropy</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('entropy'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="entropy" style='display:none;'>
<br> These are notes I took for <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~spatzier/">Ralf Spatzier</a>'s
course on entropy and its applications in dynamics. These notes are far from complete, and I hope to come
back and complete these at a point in the future when I understand entropy better.

<a href="pdfs/notes/beltrami_notes.pdf">Constructing complex structures on surfaces via the Beltrami equation</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('beltrami'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="beltrami" style='display:none;'>
  <br> These are notes I wrote a talk on the Beltrami equation and how one can use it to construct Riemann surfaces,
  and an outline of the proof of when a solution exists.
</div>
<br>

<a href="pdfs/notes/abel_jacobi.pdf">Divisors and the Abel-Jacobi map</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('abel'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="abel" style='display:none;'>
  <br> This is the term paper I wrote on divisors and the construction of the Abel-Jacobi map. The
  first goal of this paper was to convince the reader that divisors on Riemann surfaces are
  interesting objects, and once that was done, construct the moduli space of all (principal)
  divisors, which turns out to be a complex torus (this is where the Abel-Jacobi map comes in).
</div>
<br>

<a href="pdfs/notes/toric.pdf">The moment map for symplectic toric varieties</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('toric'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="toric" style='display:none;'>
  <br> This is the term paper I wrote outlining the link between toric varieties and convex
  polytopes. In particular, the goal of this paper was to work out a lot of examples going from
  convex polytopes to toric varieties, and more importantly, from toric varieties to convex
  polytopes. The latter as it turns out, can be done by constructing what is called the moment map.
  This led me to working out the convex polytopes for a class of toric varieties I did not know
  the convex polytopes of, namely the Hirzebruch surfaces.

<a href="pdfs/notes/moduliofcurves.pdf">Notes on Moduli of Curves</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('moduli'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="moduli" style='display:none;'>
  <br> These are notes I live-TeXed in the course on Moduli of Curves, taught by Aaron Pixton in Winter 2020 term at the University of Michigan. These notes mostly focus on the topological
  and algebro-geometric aspects of the theory, and not the hyperbolic/complex analytic aspects. The TeX files for these notes are <a href="pdfs/notes/moduliofcurves.pdf">here</a>. I would
  appreciate it if people send me corrections to errors in my notes via pull requests.

<a href="pdfs/notes/laplacian.pdf">The Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds</a> (<a href="notes.html#" onclick="toggle_visibility('laplacian'); return false;">about</a>)
<div id="laplacian" style='display:none;'>
  <br> This is a condensed version of my senior thesis on the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. This article
  looks at the Hodge decomposition theorem, and some geometric applications of the theorem. It also outlines
  some results relating the eigenvalues of the Laplacian to geometric properties of the manifold like
  Ricci and scalar curvature.
