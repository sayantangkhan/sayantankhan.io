### Semantic Movie Search
<a href="http://app.sayantankhan.io/search">Semantic Movie Search</a>[^1] is a search engine for movies which tries to predict what movie you are thinking of based on queries involving vaguely rememebered plot points, e.g. "cowboy doll gets jealous of spaceman toy" will give you <i>Toy Story</i>. I built this search engine along with
    <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~annabro/">Anna Brosowsky</a>,
    <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/phd-students/ynw.html">Nancy Wang</a>,
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/ethanzell/">Ethan Zell</a>,
    and <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/phd-students/zhyili.html">Yili Zhang</a>
    for the Erd√∂s Data Science bootcamp, where this project won the best project prize.
    The source code for the search engine, as well as the datasets, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sayantangkhan/movie-plot-nlp-project">Github</a>.

### Evil Set
<a href="https://sayantangkhan.github.io/evilset/">Evil Set</a> is a variant of the card games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</a> and <a href="https://smart-games.org/en/ultra_set/">Ultra Set</a> which randomizes the attributes that vary across the deck for each game. The randomized attributes get rid of the muscle memory aspect of the game, and levels the playing field between new and experienced Set players.

### Org-to-Things

[Org-to-Things](https://github.com/sayantangkhan/org-to-things) is a filter written in Haskell for Pandoc that turns Org files to links that can be imported into the iOS planner app [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/).

### Word problem for hyperbolic groups in CUDA

This is CUDA implementation of the $NC^2$-algorithm for the word problem in hyperbolic groups.
The algorithm was described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/129712.129723).

[^1]: Hosting the model on a cloud server got too expensive, so the link is currently broken, but might become active in the future if I can find a spare computer to host it on.
